  <br>
  <p ><i>This tribute manifests the magnanimity of founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah - an Amazing Pakistani statesperson. The nation he helped carved has suffered from seriously flawed perceptions in the world stage due to a number of social, economic, and political challenges. These perceptions somewhat shadowed the achievements of many of its citizens in almost all walks of life.</i></p>
